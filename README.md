## üß© Current Projects
- **Mini Sumo Robot:** Building a 500g battle bot using STM32 with mode-based behavior. Experimenting with Sharp distance sensors and high-torque motors for precise movement and agility.
- **Barcode & QR Code Scanning App:** Developed with PyQt5 and OpenCV, my app reads part labels, detects and scans codes, and updates a database in real time. Supports autofocus for high-res codes and quick retrieval of part details.
- **3D Printer Networking:** Exploring ESP32 capabilities to connect and control an Ender 3 printer remotely, leveraging Wi-Fi for ease of use and monitoring.

## üìà Highlights



### Vision-Based Object Detection
- For my robotics team, we have a huge amount of different smd components on their bags, it is not easy to start a new project and search through the numerous bags we have to see if any of the required components are available or not, so I developed a python based app using multi threadthing and QT5 for design. the app's goal is to quickly scan all the barcodes and qr codes to search different databases to determine which component it is. afterwards i added a database to store and manage the components with the ability to export into a csv or excel file.

### Hardware Design & Circuitry
- Worked with different types of amplification circuits, DAC and ADC and a whole lot of serial communication, SPI I2C.
- Worked deisgning Burshless BLDC motor drivers for different applications, including micro sumo and all the way into our rescue robot which participates in the Robocup Rescue League.
- Mosfet circuit design.

## üîç What's Next?
- **Enhanced PDF and Image Handling:** Improving UI responsiveness in PyQt5, particularly for displaying and refreshing images and PDFs seamlessly.
- **Advanced Motor Control:** Fine-tuning speed control and ramp-up algorithms for smoother, more responsive robot movement.
- **Database Integration:** Building on my app‚Äôs data handling by refining SQL-based storage solutions for quick, structured retrieval and analysis of stored data.

üí° Always curious, always improving! Let‚Äôs build something amazing together.
